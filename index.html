        <h1>About</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Cricket is the most popular outdoor game in the world.
            Amongst all the outdoor games, cricket is my favourite and I love to play this game.
            It is the most watched sport in India and people have an emotional connect towards it.
            This sport is played by using a bat and a ball between two teams of 11 members each.
            Every team has its own set of batsmen, bowlers and fielders.
            My favourite cricketer is Virat Kohli and I love the way he plays the game and leads the entire team.
            I love to play cricket with my friends, after school, on the playground nearby.
            My team members always allow me to bat first as I can score runs quickly.
            My parents have enrolled me to a cricket training centre to motivate and boost my passion in the sport.
            My aim in life is to become a renowned cricketer and play for the Indian cricket team and represent my nation on the international platform.</p>
